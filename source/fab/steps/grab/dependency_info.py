    first one is checked out, then the following are merged into the checked
    out version.

    This data is maintained in source_ref, a list of SourceRef instances.

    code is checked out to.

class DependencyInfo(dict):
    '''
    A simple dictionary-like class that stores the version information
    from a yaml file::

        casim:
            source: git@github.com:MetOffice/casim.git
            ref: 2025.12.1
        ...

    The information can be accessed as a dictionary, e.g.::

        gr = DependencyInfo("$LFRIC_APPS_SRC/dependencies.yaml")
        gr["casim"] --> {"source": "git@.../casim.git",
                         "ref": "2025.12.1"}

    A filter can be specified to restrict the repositories that
    are being handled.

    The constructor will check that each dependency has indeed
    source and ref defined (note that for lfric_apps these are
    defined, but empty, indicating to use the current directory).

    If the requested section does not exist, a key error is raised.
