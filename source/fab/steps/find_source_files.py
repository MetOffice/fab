    Find the files in the source folder, with filtering.

    Files can be included or excluded with simple pattern matching.
    Every file is included by default, unless the filters say otherwise.

    Path filters are expected to be provided by the user in an *ordered*
    collection. The two convenience subclasses,
    :class:`~fab.steps.walk_source.Include` and
    :class:`~fab.steps.walk_source.Exclude`, improve readability.

    Order matters. For example::

        path_filters = [
            Exclude('my_folder'),
            Include('my_folder/my_file.F90'),
        ]

    In the above example, swapping the order would stop the file being
    included in the build.

    A path matches a filter string simply if it *contains* it,
    so the path *my_folder/my_file.F90* would match filters
    "my_folder", "my_file" and "er/my".

    :param config:
        The :class:`fab.build_config.BuildConfig` object where we can read
        settings such as the project workspace folder or the multiprocessing
        flag.
    :param source_root:
        Optional path to source folder, with a sensible default.
    :param output_collection:
        Name of artefact collection to create, with a sensible default.
    :param path_filters:
        Iterable of Include and/or Exclude objects, to be processed in order.
    :param name:
        Human friendly name for logger output, with sensible default.
