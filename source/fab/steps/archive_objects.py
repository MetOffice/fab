class ArchiveObjects(Step):
    """
    Create an object archive for every build target, from their object files.

    An object archive is a set of object (*.o*) files bundled into a single file, typically with a *.a* extension.

    Expects one or more build targets from its artefact getter, of the form Dict[name, object_files].
    By default, it finds the build targets and their object files in the artefact collection named by
    :py:const:`fab.constants.COMPILED_FILES`.

    This step has three use cases:

    * The **object archive** is the end goal of the build.
    * The object archive is a convenience step before linking a **shared object**.
    * One or more object archives as convenience steps before linking **executables**.

    The benefit of creating an object archive before linking is simply to reduce the size
    of the linker command, which might otherwise include thousands of .o files, making any error output
    difficult to read. You don't have to use this step before linking.
    The linker step has a default artefact getter which will work with or without this preceding step.

    **Creating a Static or Shared Library:**

    When building a library there is expected to be a single build target with a `None` name.
    This typically happens when configuring the :class:`~fab.steps.analyser.Analyser` step *without* a root symbol.
    We can assume the list of object files is the entire project source, compiled.

    In this case you must specify an *output_fpath*.

    **Creating Executables:**

    When creating executables, there is expected to be one or more build targets, each with a name.
    This typically happens when configuring the :class:`~fab.steps.analyser.Analyser` step *with* a root symbol(s).
    We can assume each list of object files is sufficient to build each *<root_symbol>.exe*.

    In this case you cannot specify an *output_fpath* path because they are automatically created from the
    target name.
