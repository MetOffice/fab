Although this directory holds source it is not intended to be compiled.

Instead it demonstrates the various aspects of a Fortran source tree. It is
intended to exercise corner cases for tools like the database explorer. To
that end there are multiple files containing identically named (but
different) modules. Obviously these cannot be linked as there are ambiguous
symbol names. But the source analysis stage has to be able to deal with
things like this.
