.. _Writing Config:


How to Write a Build Config
***************************
This page walks through the process of writing a build script.

Config File
===========
Here's a simple config without any steps.

.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: build_it.py

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    from fab.build_config import BuildConfig

    with BuildConfig(project_label='<project label>') as state:
        pass

If we want to run the build script from the command line,
we give it executable permission with the command `chmod +x build_it.py`.
We also add the `shebang <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>`_ directive on line 1,
telling our computer it's a Python script.

Pick a project label. Fab creates a project workspace with this name (see :term:`Project Workspace`).


Source Code
===========
Let's tell Fab where our source code is.

We use the :func:`~fab.steps.find_source_files.find_source_files` step for this.
We can point this step to a source folder, which is a valid way to use this step.
However, because Fab can sometimes create artefacts alongside the source [1]_,
we usually copy the source into the project workspace first using a :mod:`~fab.steps.grab` step.

A grab step will copy files from a folder or remote repo into
a folder called "source" within the project workspace.

.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: build_it.py
    :emphasize-lines: 4,5,10,11

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    from fab.build_config import BuildConfig
    from fab.steps.find_source_files import find_source_files
    from fab.steps.grab import GrabFolder

    if __name__ == '__main__':

        with BuildConfig(project_label='<project label') as state:
            grab_folder(state, src='<path to source folder>')
            find_source_files(state)


.. note::
    Fab tries to minimise user input by providing *sensible defaults*.
    In this case, the user doesn't have to specify where the code goes.
    The grab and find_source_files steps already know what to do by default.
    Sensible defaults can be overridden.

Please see the documentation for :func:`~fab.steps.find_source_files.find_source_files` for more information,
including how to exclude certain source code from the build. More grab steps can be found in the :mod:`~fab.steps.grab`
module.

After the find_source_files step, there will be a collection called ``"all_source"``, in the artefact store.

.. [1] See :func:`~fab.steps.c_pragma_injector.c_pragma_injector` for an example of a step which
    creates artefacts in the source folder.



Preprocess
==========
Next we want to preprocess our source code.
Preprocessing resolves any `#include` and `#ifdef` directives in the code,
which must happen before we analyse it.

Steps generally create and find artefacts in the :term:`Artefact Store`, arranged into named collections.
The :func:`~fab.steps.preprocess.preprocess_fortran`
automatically looks for Fortran source code in a collection named `'all_source'`,
which is the default output from the preceding :funcfind_source_files step.
It filters just the (uppercase) ``.F90`` files.

.. note::

    Uppercase ``.F90`` are preprocessed into lowercase ``.f90``.

The Fortran preprocessor will read the :ref:`FPP<env_vars>` environment variable to determine which tool to call.


.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: build_it.py
    :emphasize-lines: 6,13

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import logging

    from fab.build_config import BuildConfig
    from fab.steps.find_source_files import find_source_files
    from fab.steps.preprocess import preprocess_fortran

    logger = logging.getLogger('fab')

    if __name__ == '__main__':

        with BuildConfig(project_label='<project label') as state:
            grab_folder(state, src='<path to source folder>')
            find_source_files(state)
            preprocess_fortran(state)


Preprocessed files are created in the `'build_output'` folder, inside the project workspace.
After the fortran_preprocessor step, there will be a collection called ``"preprocessed_fortran"``, in the artefact store.


.. _Analyse Overview:

Analyse
=======
We must :func:`~fab.steps.analyse.analyse` the source code to determine which Fortran files to compile,
and in which order.

The Analyse step looks for source to analyse in several collections:

* ``.f90`` found in the source
* ``.F90`` we pre-processed into ``.f90``
* preprocessed c

.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: build_it.py
    :emphasize-lines: 3,15

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import logging

    from fab.steps.analyse import analyse
    from fab.build_config import BuildConfig
    from fab.steps.find_source_files import find_source_files
    from fab.steps.grab import GrabFolder
    from fab.steps.preprocess import preprocess_fortran

    logger = logging.getLogger('fab')

    if __name__ == '__main__':

        with BuildConfig(project_label='<project label') as state:
            grab_folder(state, src='<path to source folder>')
            find_source_files(state)
            preprocess_fortran(state)
            analyse(state, root_symbol='<program>')


Here we tell the analyser which :term:`Root Symbol` we want to build into an executable.
Alternatively, we can use the ``find_programs`` flag for Fab to discover and build all programs.

After the Analyse step, there will be a collection called ``"build_trees"``, in the artefact store.


Compile and Link
================
The :func:`~fab.steps.compile_fortran.compile_fortran` step compiles files in the ``"build_trees"`` collection.
The :func:`~fab.steps.link.link_exe` step then creates the executable.

.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: build_it.py
    :emphasize-lines: 4,8,18,19

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import logging

    from fab.steps.analyse import analyse
    from fab.build_config import BuildConfig
    from fab.steps.compile_fortran import compile_fortran
    from fab.steps.find_source_files import find_source_files
    from fab.steps.grab import GrabFolder
    from fab.steps.link import link_exe
    from fab.steps.preprocess import preprocess_fortran

    logger = logging.getLogger('fab')

    if __name__ == '__main__':

        with BuildConfig(project_label='<project label') as state:
            grab_folder(state, src='<path to source folder>')
            find_source_files(state)
            preprocess_fortran(state)
            analyse(state, root_symbol='<program>')
            compile_fortran(state)
            link_exe(state)


After the :func:`~fab.steps.link.link_exe` step, the executable name can be found in a collection called ``"executables"``.


Flags
=====
Preprocess, compile and link steps usually need configuration to specify command-line arguments
to the underlying tool, such as symbol definitions, include paths, optimisation flags, etc.
See also :ref:`Advanced Flags<Advanced Flags>`.


C Code
======
Fab comes with C processing steps.
The :func:`~fab.steps.preprocess.preprocess_c` and :func:`~fab.steps.compile_c.compile_c` Steps
behave like their Fortran equivalents.

However, it currently requires a preceding step called the :func:`~fab.steps.c_pragma_injector.c_pragma_injector`.
Fab needs to inject pragmas into C code before it is preprocessed in order to know which dependencies
are for user code, and which are for system code to be ignored.
