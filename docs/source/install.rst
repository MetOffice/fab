you can install the latest release of `Fab from PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/sci-fab/>`_:

The minimum Python dependencies (e.g. `fparser <https://github.com/stfc/fparser>`_)
will also be installed automatically.

    When installing from PyPI, please be sure to install **sci-fab**, not *fab*.
    There is already a package on PyPI called *fab*, which installs something else entirely.

This will install.

* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ for producing metrics graphs after a run
* `psyclone <https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone>`_ for building LFRic, and more

Fab workspace

You can optionally tell Fab where it's workspace should live.
This can be useful on systems where your home space is on a slower drive,

    $ export FAB_WORKSPACE=<fast_drive>/fab_workspace

By default, Fab will create a project workspaces inside ``~/fab-workspace``.
